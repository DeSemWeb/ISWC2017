# A workshop that focuses on _clients_

If you are looking for Semantic Web Technologies for the Internet of Things,

## Contributions
We have received [14 contributions](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2017/DeSemWeb)
in response to our [call](/contributions/),
13 of which will be [presented](/program/) at the workshop.

log in,
and pick the contribution you want to review.

## Purpose and scope
Unfortunately,
the Semantic Web is increasingly becoming a centralized story:
we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
to perform intense reasoning, data mining, query execution, etc.
Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
to _put the “Web” back in the “Semantic Web”_,
aiming for **intelligent clients** instead of intelligent servers.
The DeSemWeb2017 workshop purposely takes a radical perspective
by focusing solely on **decentralized and client-side applications**,
to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
we see an urgent need to _revalue the role of clients_.

Submit to this workshop and help
put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
which will lead to new inspiration and initiatives
to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

> The Web is our main differentiator compared to other communities

> If we’re not betting on the Web _now_,
> we risk becoming obsolete as a Semantic Web community.
