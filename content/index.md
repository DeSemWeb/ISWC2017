# A workshop that focuses on _clients_
Unfortunately,
the Semantic Web is increasingly becoming a centralized story:
we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
to perform intense reasoning, data mining, query execution, etc.
Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
to _put the “Web” back in the “Semantic Web”_,
aiming for **intelligent clients** instead of intelligent servers.
The DeSemWeb2017 workshop purposely takes a radical perspective
by focusing solely on **decentralized and client-side applications**,
to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
we see an urgent need to _revalue the role of clients_.

Submit to this workshop and help
put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
which will lead to new inspiration and initiatives
to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

## Topics of the DeSemWeb workshop series
Submit your work on these topics and related subjects:

- intelligent Web clients through semantic technologies
  - browsers of (heterogeneous) Linked Data
  - Linked Data crawlers and processors
  - Linked Data traversal-based query evaluation
  - browser-based Linked Data applications
  - moving intelligence from servers to clients
  - interpreting small RDFa data (rather than crawling a full website)
- decentralized Semantic Web applications
  - client-side Linked Data access and manipulation
  - provenance, trust, and claim verification
  - browser extensions consuming Linked Data
  - applications of Linked Data Notifications
  - Linked Data visualizations
- enabling technologies for Web-scale decentralization
  - decentralized Linked Data architectures
  - peer-to-peer technologies for the Semantic Web
  - lightweight data interfaces
  - hypermedia markup and controls in RDF
