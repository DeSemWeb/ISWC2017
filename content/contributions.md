# Call for Contributions

## Scope
The ISWC2017 workshop on Decentralizing the Semantic Web
welcomes novel contributions on intelligent clients,
decentralized applications, and enabling technologies.
Consult the [detailed topic list](/topics/) for inspiration.

You can share three kinds of contributions:
[research articles](#research-articles),
[client challenge demos](#client-challenge),
and [vision statements](#vision-statements).
The deadline is 21 July 2017.

### Research articles
{:#research-articles}
DeSemWeb research articles provide _scientifically motivated insights_
from the domain of intelligent clients, decentralized applications,
and/or enabling technologies
covering one or more of the workshop’s [topics](/topics/).

Research articles must:

{:.inline}
- clearly state the tackled problem upfront in the abstract and introduction
- explain the differences with related work
- evaluate the contribution
  through a prototype, use case, experiments, …

We recommend to target 6,000–8,000 words (12–16 pages).

### Intelligent client challenge
{:#client-challenge}
We challenge authors to _build a demonstration_ of an intelligent Web application
that runs mostly or exclusively in a mobile or desktop browser.
Such an application could, for instance,
find information on the Web or execute tasks.
Bonus points for natural language interactions,
such as through a _chatbot_ or _speech-to-text engine_.

Please share a link to your demonstration or video,
accompanied by a description of around 1,000–4,000 words (2–8 pages).

### Vision statements
{:#vision-statements}
Share _your vision for the future_ of the Semantic Web,
with a focus on clients and/or decentralization.
Does the Semantic Web need decentralization—and
does decentralization need the Semantic Web?
Contributions on any of the [topics](/topics/) are welcome.

We recommend to target 1,000–4,000 words (2–8 pages).


## Author guidelines
Contributions must be either in HTML (recommended) or PDF,
formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format
for [Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)](http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
We especially encourage HTML contributions with semantic annotations.
Consult the [HTML guide](http://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/calls/html-submission-guide/)
for practical advice.

Accepted contributions will be published as [CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) proceedings
and need to be presented by one of the authors at the workshop.
